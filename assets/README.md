This directory contains client side code, including xterm.js 4.16

To update the xterm library to a newer version of xterm.js, run 
`npm install xterm.js` in a different directory, and then copy 
xterm.js and xterm.js.map and xterm.css and the files for three 
of xterm.js's addons to the external directory.
